    <p>Field mapping content is a yaml format configuration. Three sections are required. They are 'testset', 'test' and 'run'.
    Each section should has a 'root' property indicates the root node of the testset or test or run. Please note that test's root is based on testset's root. Run's root is based on test's root.</p>
    <p>Beside root, you can define any field you want to upload as an ALM entity. Yaml key represents the entity's field name. Yaml value represents the entity's field value.</p>
    <p>If you want to upload a value to a User defined field, you could use a key starts with 'udf|' follows by the UDF label. Such as 'udf-duration' would upload value to a UDF field which has label as 'duration'.</p>
    <p>For the yaml value part, there're two types of value. Value starts with 'x:' means the following value represents the xpath in the test result file. Value starts with 'v:' means the following value is a string value which would be applied to every entity.</p>
    <p>You can use '|' in yame value for combining several parts together.</p>

    <b>Sample test result:</b>
    <xmp><?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
