<div>
    Define one or more Jenkins users for specific workspaces in ALM Octane (relevant for v15.0.60 and later).
    <br/>
    This user will be used to get jobs to ALM Octane when creating new pipelines in that specific workspace.
    <br/>
    For all other actions, the general Jenkins user defined in the basic plugin configuration is used.
    <br/><br/>
    <b>Important</b>: The workspace-specific Jenkins user must have access to a subset of the jobs that are available to the general Jenkins user. You cannot have jobs that are available to the workspace-specific Jenkins user but not to the general Jenkins user.

    <br/><br/>
    The field is optional and does not need to include all workspaces. If a workspace does not contain a workspace-specific user, the general Jenkins user will be used.
    <br/>
    Format: 'Workspace ID: 'Jenkins user name', for example 1000:userForOctane.
    <br/><br/>
    Use a separate line for each workspace. Any line that starts with '#' is defined as a comment and is not parsed.
    <br/>
    If the configuration is defined correctly, test connection will show an icon next to "Connection successful" with all available workspaces. If a workspace has a workspace-specific Jenkins user, the user name will appear, for example <i>2001 - workspace name (userForOctane)</i>.
