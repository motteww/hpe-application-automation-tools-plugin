<div>
    <p>Run status mapping field is for mapping the test result's status values to ALM run status value.
        Yaml key represents the ALM run status values. Only one of the following status can be set here:<br>
    Passed<br>
    Failed<br>
        Yaml value represents the condition that sustains the status. Ten kinds of conditions can be set here:<br>
        ==StringValue<br>
        !=StringValue<br>

        ==0 (Or any numeric value)<br>
        !=0 (Or any numeric value)<br>

        >>0 (Or any numeric value)<br>
        <<0 (Or any numeric value)<br>

        <=0 (Or any numeric value)<br>
        >=0 (Or any numeric value)<br>

        ==NULL<br>
        !=NULL<br>

        You should first set the status field in field mapping.<br>
    </p>

<xmp>
Take following test result as example:
<test-case name="ExampleTestOfNUnit.TestMultiplicationFail" executed="True" result="Failure" success="False" time="0.122" asserts="1">
</xmp>

<b>Sample field mapping:</b>
<xmp>run:
  status: "x: success"
</xmp>
<b>Sample status mapping:</b>
<xmp>status:
    Passed: "==true"
</xmp>

    <xmp>
Take following test result as example:
<case>
    <duration>0.041</duration>
    <className>SomeClass</className>
    <testName>SomeTest-1</testName>
    <skipped>false</skipped>
    <failedSince>0</failedSince>
</case>
    </xmp>
    <b>Sample field mapping:</b>
    <xmp>run:
  status: "x: failedSince"</xmp>
        <b>Sample status mapping:</b>
    <xmp>status:
  Failed: ">=0"
    </xmp>
</div>
