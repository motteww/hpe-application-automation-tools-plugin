    This step is responsible for collecting pull requests from the SCM tool and injecting them to ALM Octane.
    See help information in  <a target="_blank" href="https://admhelp.microfocus.com/octane/en/latest/Online/Content/UserGuide/articles-pull-requests.htm">ALM Octane Help Center</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    In addition, this step is used to define the scm repositories templates that are used by ALM Octane to link to your repository viewer. To configure templates in ALM Octane, access Settings > Spaces. Select a workspace and click DevOps > SCM Repositories. Follow the on-screen instructions.
    <br>
    <br>
    Every time pull requests are sent to ALM Octane the last update time is saved. The next time, only pull requests and commits that were updated after this time will be sent to ALM Octane.

    <br>
    <br>
    Supported version of ALM Octane: 15.0.49 and later.


    <br>
    <br>
    You can change the behaviour of this step by adding the following parameters to the job:
    <ul>
        <li><b>pullrequests_min_update_time</b>: Use this parameter to override the last update time that is updated after each successful injection to ALM Octane.</li><br>
        <li><b>pullrequests_max_pr_to_collect</b>: Max number of pull requests to collect. Default is 100.</li><br>
        <li><b>pullrequests_max_commits_to_collect</b>: Max number of commits to collect for each pull request. Default is 100.</li><br>
    </ul>
