                This is usually done to add one more security layer. Some such servers might not allow receiving requests with encoded slashes (%2F).
                As a job name might contain a slash, this parameter allows base64 encoding for job IDs during sending test results, build logs, coverage and vulnerabilities data to ALM Octane.

                The cache is updated only if required by ALM Octane, and the previous cache was updated more than one hour ago. The cache is not updated when adding/removing/renaming jobs.

                runId, suiteRunId, suiteId, octaneWorkspaceId, octaneSpaceId, octaneRunByUsername, octaneUrl, octaneConfigId. In addition, if your job contains other parameters that contains "octane"(case insensitive) in the name of parameter - they will be added.
