    The integration with SonarQube works by using Sonarâ€™s webhook mechanism, and contains several phases:
    <ol>
        <li> The plugin automatically configures a webhook in Sonar before the job runs (this requires an access token
            with global 'Administer' permission).
        </li>
        <li> When the Sonar analysis is ready, the SonarQube server calls the configured webhook.</li>
        <li> Results are then submitted to ALM Octane for further analysis (this requires an access token with 'Read'
            permissions).
        </li>
    </ol>

    If you cannot assign global 'Administer' permissions to the Sonar token (for the first phase), select "Skip webhook
    creation", and define a webhook manually in the Sonar server (either at the global level or project level) to the
    following URL: {jenkins_url}/webhooks/notify
