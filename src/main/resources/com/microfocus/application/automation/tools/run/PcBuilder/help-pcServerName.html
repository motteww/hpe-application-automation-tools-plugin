<div>
    Hostname or IP address
    The LoadRunner Enterprise Hostname or IP address. If the port of the LRE server is different than the default one, mention it by adding a collon (:) and then the port number<br/>
    <b>Example</b>: mypcserver.mycompany.net or 182.138.255.1 or mypcserver.mycompany.net:81<br/>
    <br/>
    If the LRE server requires to be accessed via a tenant, you can specify it by adding the tenant details to the LRE Server field.<br/>
    <b>Example</b>: mypcserver.mycompany.net/?tenant=fa128c06-5436-413d-9cfa-9f04bb738df3 or 182.138.255.1/?tenant=fa128c06-5436-413d-9cfa-9f04bb738df3 or mypcserver.mycompany.net:81/?tenant=fa128c06-5436-413d-9cfa-9f04bb738df3<br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Important</b>: Do not use the full URL of LoadRunner Enterprise server. <br/>
    For example, using https://mypcserver/LoadTest will fail. Instead, just specify 'mypcserver' value in 'LRE Server' field and switch on the 'Use HTTPS Protocol' if secured protocol is required.
